Hello, my name is Steph Beneschan and this is my submission for the first challenge of Lighthall's 2023 Software Engineering Super League.

## Resources Used
* In order to set up the application quickly, I used the official Create React App command, as described here:

* To obtain the name of the user's city from their device location, I programmed the application to use the Geoapify Reverse Geocoding API, described here:

* Click data for different cities is stored using a Firebase Realtime Database, as described here:
